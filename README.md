# constructor-word-guess

Technology Used: Node.js, Javascript, color, and inquirer

To play the game first you will need to install color and inquirer. Then you will run the game using "node index.js". Once the game is running it will prompt you to guess a letter. Enter a letter to check and see if it is in the word. The game will let you know if it is included in the word and then it will display the string with the letters that have already been guessed revealed. 

Enjoy.
